# A npm workspaces tRPC example

Requires node 18 (for global fetch).

## Playing around

```bash
# install all workspaces dependencies & create workspaces links
npm i
```

Within *client/* and *server/* respectively, run

```bash
npm run dev
```

Try editing the ts files to see the type checking in action :)

## Building

npm run start
```
